# Aliigo Partner & Affiliate Program (Draft)

This is a working outline for a future affiliate/partner program. It is not live yet.
We can launch after the product is more mature and (optionally) a white‑label offer exists.

## Program Types

**Affiliate**
- For creators, communities, and referrers.
- Simple referral links + payout.

**Partner / Agency**
- For service providers installing Aliigo for clients.
- Higher commissions + enablement + priority support.

## Value Proposition

- Earn revenue for qualified referrals.
- Priority onboarding help and enablement materials.
- Optional co‑marketing (case studies, listings).

## Compensation (Best Practices)

**Affiliate**
- 20%–30% recurring for 6–12 months, or
- 30%–40% one‑time on first payment.

**Agency**
- 20%–35% recurring while the client is active.
- Volume tiers:
  - 5+ clients: 25%
  - 10+ clients: 30%
  - 20+ clients: 35%

**Bonuses**
- Milestone bonuses after X activated customers.

## Attribution & Tracking

- Unique referral links + coupon codes.
- Cookie window: 60–90 days (standard).
- Last‑touch attribution (unless otherwise decided).

## Trial & Conversion Policy

- Trials count as leads.
- Payout only after the first paid invoice.
- Refunds/chargebacks void commission.

## Eligibility & Rules

- No bidding on “Aliigo” without approval.
- No misleading claims or fake reviews.
- Must follow brand guidelines.
- Compliance with GDPR/CCPA and disclosure rules.

## Onboarding

- Application form and review.
- Approval within 48 hours.
- Starter kit: assets, copy blocks, FAQs.

## Support

- Partner support email (priority queue).
- Optional Slack channel for agencies.

## Program Tiers (Optional)

- Starter Partner
- Pro Partner
- Elite Partner

## Offboarding

- Violations can revoke access and payouts.
- Inactivity can pause benefits.

## Notes / Future

- Consider a white‑label plan before launching.
- Publish this into Help Center once timelines are confirmed.

## White‑Label Summary (Decision)

- **Do not launch white‑label yet.**
- It multiplies support, branding, and billing complexity.
- Best path is **co‑branded first**, then full white‑label later.
- Gate full white‑label behind a premium tier and minimum volume.

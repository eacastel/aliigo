# Aliigo — Pending Ideas (No Dates)

This file tracks discussed items that are **not implemented yet**.
No dates. We’ll move fast once we decide.

## Highest interest
- Add a “Need help?” pill on the signup page that opens the widget with guided help (mobile‑friendly).
- Extend the widget across the site (not only homepage) with page‑aware guidance and soft prompts.

## Backlog (discussed, not implemented)
- Knowledgebase ingestion from URLs (auto‑pull external sources into assistant knowledge).
- Stripe lifecycle emails (upgrade/downgrade/cancel) via webhooks.
- Messages UX refinement (accordion view, improved back navigation, polish).
- Server‑side Google Ads conversion (more robust attribution).
- Additional GA4/Ads events (trial start, billing activation, plan changes).
- Expanded onboarding/installation knowledgebase content beyond the initial help section.
- Help center screenshots (manual capture).
- Conversation link reliability audit in lead notification emails (edge cases).
- Deeper assistant behavior tuning in the conversation pipeline beyond the initial soft‑tone rules.
